## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Flutter SDK** (3.x or later) — [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter plugins
- **Android Emulator** or a physical Android device
- **Firebase account** — [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Step 1: Clone / Extract the Project

### Option 1: Clone using Git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AttendanceManagementSystem_App.git
cd AttendanceManagementSystem_App

### Option 2: Download ZIP
Download the ZIP file from GitHub, extract it, and open the extracted project folder (e.g., `AttendanceManagementSystem_App` or `AttendanceManagementSystem_App-main`) in your IDE.

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase (Required)

This app uses **Firebase Firestore** for cloud data. You need to create your own Firebase project:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click **"Create a project"** → Name it anything (e.g., `attendance-system`)
3. Once created, click **"Add app"** → Select **Android**
4. Enter the package name: **`com.attendance.attendance_app`**
5. Click **Register App**
6. Download the `google-services.json` file
7. Place it in: `android/app/google-services.json`

> ⚠️ **The app will NOT build without this file.** If you already see a `google-services.json` in the project, you can use it directly for testing.

#### Firebase Console — Enable Firestore:
1. In your Firebase project, go to **Build → Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (for development)
4. Select a region and click **Enable**

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

> On first launch, the app automatically seeds demo data (professors, students, subjects, attendance history) into your Firestore. This may take 30-60 seconds on the first run.

## 🔐 Demo Login Credentials

The app comes with pre-seeded demo data. Use these credentials to test:

### Admin
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `admin@gmail.com` |
| Password | `admin123` |

| `amit.verma@cse.com` | `password123` |
| `priya.das@cse.com` | `password123` |
| `vikram.singh@cse.com` | `password123` |

### Student (105 demo students)
| Field | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Enrollment No | `11111` to `11215` |

## 📊 Database Schema

| Collection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `courses` | B.Tech, MCA, etc. |
| `subjects` | Core + elective subjects per semester |
| `students` | Student profiles with elective selections |
| `professors` | Professor profiles with subject assignments |

### SQLite Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `students` | Local student data for login |
| `subjects` | Local subject cache |
| `attendance_sessions` | Local attendance sessions |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App crashes on launch
- Make sure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
- Make sure Firestore Database is **enabled** in Firebase Console

### Build fails with Gradle errors
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### First launch is slow
This is normal — the `DemoDataSeeder` is creating 100+ students, subjects, professors, and 2 months of attendance history in Firestore. Subsequent launches will be fast.

### "Firebase not initialized" error
Ensure you have:
1. `google-services.json` in `android/app/`
2. Firebase Firestore enabled in test mode
3. Internet connection on first run

## 📝 Notes for Developers

- **Passwords are stored in plain text** — This is a demo/academic project. For production, implement proper hashing (bcrypt/argon2).
- **Admin & HOD credentials are hardcoded** — See `admin_login_screen.dart` and `hod_login_screen.dart`. For production, move to Firestore-based auth.
- **Demo data auto-seeds once** — The seeder checks if data already exists before inserting. To re-seed, clear the Firestore collections manually.
- **Material 3 Dark Theme** — The app uses a custom dark theme with deep indigo-purple accent (`#6C63FF`).
